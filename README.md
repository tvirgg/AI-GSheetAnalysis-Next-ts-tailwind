## Introduction
This project is a web application built using TypeScript and React for creating a user interface. The project consists of various pages, components, and API routes for server-side interaction.

## Project Structure

### Components
The `components` folder contains reusable UI elements:

- **Navbar.js**: A navigation bar displayed at the top of the page. It contains links to key sections of the site.
- **Sidebar.js**: A sidebar navigation panel that provides users with access to various functions and pages.
- **WelcomeNavigation.js**: A navigation component used to greet new or unauthenticated users.

### The `app` Folder
The `app` folder contains the main structure of pages and API routes:

- **favicon.ico**: The site icon displayed in the browser tab.
- **globals.css**: A global stylesheet applied to all application pages.
- **layout.tsx**: The main layout component providing a common interface for all pages (e.g., header, footer).
- **page.tsx**: The main application page loaded by default.
- **api**: A folder with API routes for server-side interaction.
  - **private/route.ts**: A private API route designed for working with protected data.
  - **[...nextauth]/route.ts**: A route responsible for authentication via NextAuth.
- **dashboard**: A folder containing dashboard functionality.
  - **page.tsx**: The main dashboard page.
  - **ai/page.tsx**: A page related to AI-based features.
  - **my/page.tsx**: The "My Data" page displaying user-specific information.
  - **reports/page.tsx**: A page for creating and viewing reports.
- **lib**: Utility libraries and configurations.
  - **actions.ts**: Contains actions (functions) used for interacting with different parts of the application.
  - **prisma.ts**: Configuration for working with the Prisma database.
- **signin/page.tsx**: The user authentication page.
- **signup/page.tsx**: The registration page for new users.
- **test/page.tsx**: A test page for verifying various application features.

## Component Descriptions

### Navbar
**File**: `components/Navbar.js`

The Navbar is a navigation bar displayed at the top of all application pages. It contains essential links required for moving between different sections of the site.

### Sidebar
**File**: `components/Sidebar.js`

The Sidebar is a navigation panel designed to simplify access to application features and pages. It is mainly used on dashboard pages and provides additional navigation options.

### WelcomeNavigation
**File**: `components/WelcomeNavigation.js`

The WelcomeNavigation component displays navigation options for greeting new users. It may include links to registration and login pages.

## Pages and Routes Description

### Main Pages

- **layout.tsx**: The main layout of the application, defining common elements (such as header and footer) used across all pages. The layout is responsible for designing pages with a consistent user interface. It provides a structure that includes navigation and key sections available on every page.

- **page.tsx**: The main application page where user interaction starts. It contains basic information about the application and provides access to key sections. The main page may include a welcome message, an application description, and links to other important pages.

### API Routes

- **private/route.ts**: A private API route requiring authentication. It is used for handling protected data such as user information or confidential application data. This route ensures that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive operations.

- **[...nextauth]/route.ts**: A route responsible for user authentication using NextAuth. It handles authentication and session management, including user registration, login, and logout. This route is essential for maintaining application security and controlling access to various sections.

### Dashboard

- **dashboard/page.tsx**: The main dashboard page providing an overview and access to application features. This page displays key information such as statistics, recent activities, or summary data and serves as a starting point for dashboard interactions.

- **dashboard/ai/page.tsx**: A page related to artificial intelligence features. It may include analytical functions or AI-based recommendations. This page provides users with access to AI-powered tools for data analysis or suggestions.

- **dashboard/my/page.tsx**: The "My Data" page, where users can view and edit their personal information. This includes contact details, account settings, and other personal data that users can modify anytime.

- **dashboard/reports/page.tsx**: A page for creating and viewing reports. It allows users to analyze data and obtain summaries. Users can generate reports based on available data, view report history, and export reports for further use.

### Utility Libraries

- **actions.ts**: A file containing action functions used for interacting with various application components. These actions may include handling user events and server interactions. The main goal of these functions is to ensure consistent execution of frequently used operations such as sending data to the server or updating application state.

- **prisma.ts**: A configuration file for connecting to the database using Prisma. It defines settings and connections for interacting with the database, including table access and executing queries. Prisma simplifies database interaction by providing a convenient API for CRUD operations.

### Authentication and Testing Pages

- **signin/page.tsx**: The user authentication page. It provides a form for entering login credentials and mechanisms for password recovery or third-party login. Authentication is necessary for ensuring security and restricting access to private data.

- **signup/page.tsx**: The new user registration page. It contains a form for creating an account, including fields for entering a name, email address, and password. Registration allows new users to create an account and start using the application.

- **test/page.tsx**: A test page for verifying various application features. Used by developers for debugging and testing new functionalities before releasing them to the main application. This page may contain temporary UI elements or functions needed for testing application logic.
